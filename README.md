# Modern C++ Practice Repository

This repository contains C++ projects and practice exercises focused on **modern C++** features and best practices. The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of C++ concepts and improve my coding skills through hands-on projects.

## About

I am actively practicing **modern C++** techniques including:

- C++11/14/17/20 features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Smart pointers and memory management
- Lambda expressions and functional programming
- Multithreading and concurrency
- File I/O and data structures
- Exception handling and debugging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or C++20 (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Build tools like `make` or an IDE such as **VS Code**, **CLion**, or **Visual Studio**
- Tested under VS Code using Ubuntu 22.04


## Goals

* Practice **clean, readable, and maintainable C++ code**
* Explore advanced C++ features and modern programming techniques
* Build a strong foundation in **software development principles** using C++
